# System Analysis and Design HW

***
## Team C++ System Analysis and Design Term Project
You can find more about the project in the [project page](https://anikgvsu.github.io/buddybites_webpage/)

### Project Overview:

The Buddy Bites project is a comprehensive and innovative mobile application aimed at combining event planning and culinary exploration into one seamless experience. Developed by our team, "Team C++," this project embodies the intersection of social connectivity and gastronomic exploration. As we present the project to you, we aim to showcase not only its creative potential but also the practical and real-world value it holds.

### Business Need and Value:

At its core, Buddy Bites was conceived to address a fundamental business need: simplifying the process of organizing social gatherings while catering to the diverse dietary preferences of our users. The modern world is increasingly defined by social connectivity, and with our app, we meet this demand head-on. Buddy Bites streamlines event planning, reduces the stress of accommodating various dietary restrictions, and makes event management a breeze. This project is grounded in the principle of delivering genuine value to its users, enhancing their overall quality of life, and providing a platform for enjoyable culinary experiences.

### Technology Stack:

The project leverages the power of React Native for front-end development and Firebase for backend functionality. By deploying it through Expo, we ensure a simplified, cross-platform approach that brings our vision to a wider audience.

### Challenges and Solutions:

Throughout the semester, we encountered a few challenges, including the implementation of push notifications and Expo deployment. Learning experiences from these challenges have enhanced our problem-solving skills and deepened our understanding of mobile app development.

### Future Outlook:

As we move forward, the Buddy Bites project holds incredible potential for further expansion and refinement. It's not just an academic endeavor; it's a market-ready application that can be further developed, tested, and deployed to meet the growing demand for user-friendly event planning and culinary exploration tools.
